	      <p>Panda Stuffed Animal by Yash       
        <br>-Built more like a reskinned teddy bear and not a panda bear.
        <br>-It wasn't fat like a panda but still had a bit more stuffing.
        <br>-Had black bead eyes surrounded by a black spot on its white face.
        <br>-Its ears were black and popped out of the head. they looked like a half-circle cut off-center.
        <br>-Its upper body, arms, and legs are black while its lower body is white.
        <br>-It had a little red bow around the neck
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I have developed several versions of the design. In the first version of my design, I chose the front view, 
        tried to create a symmetrical illustration. The sketch and the beta version in p5.js are attached. 
        However, I abandoned this design before the finish, because I think this front view is not attractive enough.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/b46906fb-9ab0-4e04-8e99-f8d36ddc8b5d%2FWK1-V1.jpg?v=1630864742713"
        />
        
      </div>
    
          <div class="fullwidth">
        <!-- below width and height refers to the dimensions of your sketch-->

      <iframe 
          width="400px"
          height="500px"
          src="https://preview.p5js.org/huah511/embed/5cvta2pti"></iframe>

      <p>
         In the second version, I shifted the perspective. In this design, the panda is still constructed by basic shapes, 
        but with a more specific mode. I used “arc();” for the cut circle and “quad();” for quadrangle on the red bow. 
        The draft is attached.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/b46906fb-9ab0-4e04-8e99-f8d36ddc8b5d%2FWK1-V2.jpg?v=1630864759670"
        />
      </div>
            
      <p>
        I also coded a background that simulates the shaking motion of bamboo with the function of “random();”. 
        But this function will be overlaid under the function of “blendMode();”. 
        So I shifted this animation to its right hand with a result of a more vivid look. (I temporarily stopped this annoying effect)
        However, I am still in the progress of controlling the speed.

        Yash has described the appearance of his teddy panda bear in details. 
        His words also give me the logic to build this image on the canvas. 
        The basic principle is that I deconstructed this panda into basic shapes. 
        By shading the front and back of the basic shapes and contrasting black and white colors, 
        I created this illustration of a panda.
