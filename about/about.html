      The Story Behind FLEXIDOTS:
    </h1>
    <p>FLEXIDOTS is developed by <a href="https://studiohuahong.com/">Hong Hua</a>. It is also his thesis project for his master degree at Design & Technology, Parsons School of Design, the New School. This project was supervised by <a href="https://nancyvalladares.site/">Nancy Valladares</a>, <a href="https://dantaeyoung.com/">Dan Taeyoung</a>, and Barbara Morris, and a special thanks to our colleagues and friends from the DT community for their support!
    <p>The initial motivation for this project was to change the methodology for prototyping wearable physical
      computing. Existing wearable solutions are often associated with electronic textile, such as <a
        href="https://learn.adafruit.com/category/flora">Flora</a> by Adafruit or <a
        href="https://www.sparkfun.com/lilypad_sewable_electronics">Lilypad</a> by Sparkfun. These ecosystems, which
      require conducting threads to knit the circuits, do not meet the needs of rapid prototyping and increase learning
      costs. Inspired by <a href="https://sphero.com/collections/design-build-systems">littleBits</a>, FLEXIDOTS has
      modular system and adaptive wearable attachments, which is intended to address the challenge of making ergonomic,
      simplistic, and durable wearable electronics.</p>
    <p>FLEXIDOTS is an open-source project. This project also builds on many other open source projects, including
      hardware: <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://microbit.org/">micro:bit</a>, <a
        href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/">Seeed Studio Grove</a>, software: <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, <a
        href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. We welcome everyone to download, make use of, modify and share
      under open source MIT license.</p>
